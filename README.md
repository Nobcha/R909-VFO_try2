# R909-VFO_try2 
I will remodel the Chinese airband receiver wih R909-VFO to incorpolate the digital local oscillator.

1. I would like to recommend this trial for the people who bought the Chinese airband receiver kit and is stocked it on the shelf undemanded.
   I will introduce 3 remodeling features. Digital local oscillator, squelch improving, and sharper filter. 

2. According with designing R909-DSP of Si4732＋Si5351a＋Arduino radio board, I got R909-VFO borard. We can divert this VFO for the obsolete radio kit.

We shall use the data in /R909-VFO/.

Note and thanks
This trial and design was intended for nobcha(JA3KPA)s interesting and usage personally. I shall not assure the result. To follow this trial you shall prepare a certain knowledge and skill to produce, assemble, and solder. After you understand the contents of the schematic and the parts on the BOM, you shall start experiment.
I’m much thanking for peoples who are providing WEB information and the libraries of Arduino.
